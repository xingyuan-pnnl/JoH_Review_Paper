abstract = {This article provides a synthesis of literature values to trace the fate of 150 Tg/yr anthropogenic nitrogen applied by humans to the Earth{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s land surface. Approximately 9 TgN/yr may be accumulating in the terrestrial biosphere in pools with residence times of ten to several hundred years. Enhanced fluvial transport of nitrogen in rivers and percolation to groundwater accounts for ≈35 and 15 TgN/yr, respectively. Greater denitrification in terrestrial soils and wetlands may account for the loss of ≈17 TgN/yr from the land surface, calculated by a compilation of data on the fraction of N2O emitted to the atmosphere and the current global rise of this gas in the atmosphere. A recent estimate of atmospheric transport of reactive nitrogen from land to sea (NOx and NHx) accounts for 48 TgN/yr. The total of these enhanced sinks, 124 TgN/yr, is less than the human-enhanced inputs to the land surface, indicating areas of needed additional attention to global nitrogen biogeochemistry. Policy makers should focus on increasing nitrogen-use efficiency in fertilization, reducing transport of reactive N to rivers and groundwater, and maximizing denitrification to its N2 endproduct.},

    abstract = { FLUXNET is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S. FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community. (Data and site information are available online at the FLUXNET Web site, http://www-eosdis.ornl.gov/FLUXNET/.) Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the regional networks are intercomparable. And third, FLUXNET supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are being generated by sensors mounted on the NASA Terra satellite. Data being compiled by FLUXNET are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil–plant–atmosphere trace gas exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net CO2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by about 5.7 g C m−2 day−1 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem CO2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of CO2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal temperature of net CO2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities. }

abstract = {Ecosystem services, the benefits ecosystems provide to people, and hydrologic services, the subset of terrestrial ecosystem services related to water, appear with increasing frequency in water resources research and watershed management. Linking biophysical function to human well-being is central to the theory of ecosystem services, so distinctive characteristics of research on hydrologic services arise from addressing the way people are affected by ecohydrologic processes. However, based on a rapid scoping of 381 peer-reviewed studies of hydrologic services, I identified only a small fraction that appear to effectively make the link from biophysical processes to people. In their abstracts, many of the reviewed articles use the language of hydrologic services but appear to be essentially disciplinary studies, accounting for either biophysical functioning or specific beneficiaries in their analysis, but not both. In addition to guiding research, the direct link from biophysical processes to human well-being makes hydrologic services an appealing foundation for watershed management. The hydrologic services framework has been used to assess conservation benefits, evaluate management practices, prioritize siting, account for externalities, and perform trade-off or cost-benefit analysis. Hydrologic services hold potential for novel research and effective watershed management, but challenges remain in executing interdisciplinary research and in addressing the idiosyncratic demands of local management.

abstract = {Abstract Downstream flow in rivers is repeatedly delayed by hydrologic exchange with off-channel storage zones where biogeochemical processing occurs. We present a dimensionless metric that quantifies river connectivity as the balance between downstream flow and the exchange of water with the bed, banks, and floodplains. The degree of connectivity directly influences downstream water quality — too little connectivity limits the amount of river water exchanged and leads to biogeochemically inactive water storage, while too much connectivity limits the contact time with sediments for reactions to proceed. Using a metric of reaction significance based on river connectivity, we provide evidence that intermediate levels of connectivity, rather than the highest or lowest levels, are the most efficient in removing nitrogen from Northeastern United States’ rivers. Intermediate connectivity balances the frequency, residence time, and contact volume with reactive sediments, which can maximize the reactive processing of dissolved contaminants and the protection of downstream water quality. Our simulations suggest denitrification dominantly occurs in riverbed hyporheic zones of streams and small rivers, whereas vertical turbulent mixing in contact with sediments dominates in mid-size to large rivers. The metrics of connectivity and reaction significance presented here can facilitate scientifically based prioritizations of river management strategies to protect the values and functions of river corridors.},,

abstract = {Nitrate-N (NO3 -- N) is one of the most pervasive contaminants in groundwater. Nitrate in groundwater exhibits long-term behavior due to complex interactions at multiple scales among various geophysical factors, such as sources of nitrate-N, characteristics of the vadose zone and aquifer attributes. To minimize contamination of nitrate-N in groundwater, it is important to estimate hot spots ({\textgreater}10 mg/L of                                        NO3 -- N), trends and persistence of nitrate-N in groundwater. To analyze the trends and persistence of nitrate-N in groundwater at multiple spatio-temporal scales, we developed and used an entropy-based method along with the Hurst exponent in two different hydrogeologic settings: the Trinity and Ogallala Aquifers in Texas at fine (2 km × 2 km), intermediate (10 km × 10 km) and coarse (100 km × 100 km) scales. Results show that nitrate-N exhibits long-term persistence at the intermediate and coarse scales. In the Trinity Aquifer, overall mean nitrate-N has declined with a slight increase in normalized marginal entropy (NME) over each decade from 1940 to 2008; however, the number of hot spots has increased over time. In the Ogallala Aquifer, overall mean nitrate-N has increased with slight moderation in                                        NME since 1940; however, the number of hot spots has significantly decreased for the same period at all scales.},

@article{Clark2008,
abstract = {[1] The problems of identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure remain outstanding research challenges for the discipline of hydrology. Progress on these problems requires understanding of the nature of differences between models. This paper presents a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures: the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE). FUSE was used to construct 79 unique model structures by combining components of 4 existing hydrological models. These new models were used to simulate streamflow in two of the basins used in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX): the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina). Results show that the new models produced simulations of streamflow that were at least as good as the simulations produced by the models that participated in the MOPEX experiment. Our initial application of the FUSE method for the Guadalupe River exposed relationships between model structure and model performance, suggesting that the choice of model structure is just as important as the choice of model parameters. However, further work is needed to evaluate model simulations using multiple criteria to diagnose the relative importance of model structural differences in various climate regimes and to assess the amount of independent information in each of the models. This work will be crucial to both identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure. To facilitate research on these problems, the FORTRAN-90 source code for FUSE is available upon request from the lead author.},

abstract = {The watershed is a fundamental concept in hydrology and is the basis for understanding hydrologic processes and for the planning and management of water resources. Storage and movement of water at a watershed scale is complicated due to the coupled processes which act over multiple spatial and temporal scales. In addition, climate change and human activities increase the complexity of these processes driving hydrologic change. Scientific advances in the field of watershed hydrology is now making use of the latest methods and technologies to achieve responsible management of water resources to meet the needs of rising populations and the protection of important ecosystems. The selected papers cover a wide range of issues that are relevant to watershed hydrology and have motivated model development, application, parameterization, uncertainty estimation, environment assessment, and management. Continued technological advances grounded in modern environmental science are necessary to meet these challenges. This will require a greater emphasis on disciplinary collaboration and integrated approaches to problem solving founded on science-driven innovations in technology, socio-economics, and public policy.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.},

abstract = {Model benchmarking allows us to separate uncertainty in model predictions caused by model inputs from uncertainty due to model structural error. We extend this method with a "large-sample" approach (using data from multiple field sites) to measure prediction uncertainty caused by errors in (i) forcing data, (ii) model parameters, and (iii) model structure, and use it to compare the efficiency of soil moisture state and evapotranspiration flux predictions made by the four land surface models in the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2). Parameters dominated uncertainty in soil moisture estimates and forcing data dominated uncertainty in evapotranspiration estimates; however, the models themselves used only a fraction of the information available to them. This means that there is significant potential to improve all three components of the NLDAS-2 system. In particular, continued work toward refining the parameter maps and look-up tables, the forcing data measurement and processing, and also the land surface models themselves, has potential to result in improved estimates of surface mass and energy balances.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

abstract = {In order to understand runoff generation processes on a forested hillslope involving large heterogeneities, this study monitored runoff from a steep hillslope with a thin soil layer as well as matric potential within it and analyzed their responses to storm rainfall. A comparison of storm runoff responses from the study slope with those from two adjacent catchments, one of which includes it, showed that physical properties of the slope reflected the runoff characteristics: although no responses occurred in very dry conditions because of the absence of wet zones near the stream, the area contributing to storm runoff more rapidly extended to the whole slope due to its topographic properties. They also caused its steep hydrographs produced in the wettest condition where almost all the rainfall contributed to storm runoff. In this wettest condition, tensiometric responses near bedrock showed the vertical quick propagation of the rainfall pulse, and a good agreement of storm hydrograph simulated through a kinematic wave runoff model suggested that runoff from the slope was produced by a lateral flow on the bedrock receiving the quick propagation. In a transition process from dry to the wettest conditions, the development of the lateral flow producing smaller responses at the downslope end was estimated from decreasing of matric potential near bedrock from high negative to low values with increasing cumulative rainfall.},

abstract = {In this study, we examined the characteristics of soil moisture dynamics of wet and dry fields across hierarchical spatial scales within the region of Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) hydrology campaign in Iowa. The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR)-based remotely sensed surface (∼0–5 cm) soil moisture at 800 m×800 m resolution was used in this study. Wavelet-based multiresolution technique decomposed the soil moisture into large-scale mean soil moisture fields and fluctuations in horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions at hierarchical spatial resolutions. Results suggested linearity in the log–log dependency of the variance of soil moisture up to a resolution of 6400 m×6400 m on PSR sampling dates during SMEX02. The wet fields (with high soil moisture) show almost similar variance for all the resolutions signifying the strong spatial correlation. Analysis of the dry fields (with low soil moisture) indicated a log–log linearity of moments with various scales, and the slopes of these relationships exhibit a concave functional form with the order of moments, typically representing a multiscaling process. The scaling exponent of soil moisture during dry-down suggests a transition from simple scaling (in wet fields) to multiscaling (in dry fields) behavior. The fluctuation components of multiresolution analysis in the horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions for dry and wet fields exhibited self-similarity. Another important finding of this study is the increase of subpixel soil moisture variability with increasing resolution, especially for the wet fields. These findings will help develop appropriate up-and down-scaling schemes of remotely sensed soil moisture data for various hydrologic and environmental modeling applications.},

Predictive capability of land models for northern wetland CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions is still low due to limited site measurements, strong spatial and temporal variability in emissions, and complex hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics. To explore this issue, we compare wetland CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission predictions from the Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5-BGC) with site- to regional-scale observations. A comparison of the CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes with eddy flux data highlighted needed changes to the model's estimate of aerenchyma area, which we implemented and tested. The model modification substantially reduced biases in CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions when compared with CarbonTracker CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} predictions. CLM4.5 CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission predictions agree well with growing season (May–September) CarbonTracker Alaskan regional-level CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} predictions and site-level observations. However, CLM4.5 underestimated CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions in the cold season (October–April). The monthly atmospheric CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} mole fraction enhancements due to wetland emissions are also assessed using the Weather Research and Forecasting-Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model coupled with daily emissions from CLM4.5 and compared with aircraft CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} mole fraction measurements from the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) campaign. Both the tower and aircraft analyses confirm the underestimate of cold-season CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions by CLM4.5. The greatest uncertainties in predicting the seasonal CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} cycle are from the wetland extent, cold-season CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} production and CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} transport processes. We recommend more cold-season experimental studies in high-latitude systems, which could improve the understanding and parameterization of ecosystem structure and function during this period. Predicted CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions remain uncertain, but we show here that benchmarking against observations across spatial scales can inform model structural and parameter improvements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A reaction network with the Community Land Model carbon–nitrogen (CLM-CN) decomposition, nitrification, denitrification, and plant uptake is used as an example. We implement the reactions in the open-source PFLOTRAN (massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport) code and couple it with the CLM. To make the rate formulae designed for use in explicit time stepping in CLMs compatible with the implicit time stepping used in PFLOTRAN, the Monod substrate rate-limiting function with a residual concentration is used to represent the limitation of nitrogen availability on plant uptake and immobilization. We demonstrate that CLM–PFLOTRAN predictions (without invoking PFLOTRAN transport) are consistent with CLM4.5 for Arctic, temperate, and tropical sites.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Switching from explicit to implicit method increases rigor but introduces numerical challenges. Care needs to be taken to use scaling, clipping, or log transformation to avoid negative concentrations during the Newton iterations. With a tight relative update tolerance (STOL) to avoid false convergence, an accurate solution can be achieved with about 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%} more computing time than CLM in point mode site simulations using either the scaling or clipping methods. The log transformation method takes 60–100{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%} more computing time than CLM. The computing time increases slightly for clipping and scaling; it increases substantially for log transformation for half saturation decrease from 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}mol m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, which normally results in decreasing nitrogen concentrations.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Vast carbon stocks stored in permafrost soils of Arctic tundra are under risk of release to the atmosphere under warming climate scenarios. Ice-wedge polygons in the low-gradient polygonal tundra create a complex mosaic of microtopographic features. This microtopography plays a critical role in regulating the fine-scale variability in thermal and hydrological regimes in the polygonal tundra landscape underlain by continuous permafrost. Modeling of thermal regimes of this sensitive ecosystem is essential for understanding the landscape behavior under the current as well as changing climate. We present here an end-to-end effort for high-resolution numerical modeling of thermal hydrology at real-world field sites, utilizing the best available data to characterize and parameterize the models. We develop approaches to model the thermal hydrology of polygonal tundra and apply them at four study sites near Barrow, Alaska, spanning across low to transitional to high-centered polygons, representing a broad polygonal tundra landscape. A multiphase subsurface thermal hydrology model (PFLOTRAN) was developed and applied to study the thermal regimes at four sites. Using a high-resolution lidar digital elevation model (DEM), microtopographic features of the landscape were characterized and represented in the high-resolution model mesh. The best available soil data from field observations and literature were utilized to represent the complex heterogeneous subsurface in the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the developed modeling approach to capture {\&}ndash; without recourse to model calibration {\&}ndash; several aspects of the complex thermal regimes across the sites, and provide insights into the critical role of polygonal tundra microtopography in regulating the thermal dynamics of the carbon-rich permafrost soils. Areas of significant disagreement between model results and observations highlight the importance of field-based observations of soil thermal and hydraulic properties for modeling-based studies of permafrost thermal dynamics, and provide motivation and guidance for future observations that will help address model and data gaps affecting our current understanding of the system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Rubin2010a,
abstract = {[1] This paper addresses the inverse problem in spatially variable fields such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater aquifers or rainfall intensity in hydrology. Common to all these problems is the existence of a complex pattern of spatial variability of the target variables and observations, the multiple sources of data available for characterizing the fields, the complex relations between the observed and target variables and the multiple scales and frequencies of the observations. The method of anchored distributions (MAD) that we propose here is a general Bayesian method of inverse modeling of spatial random fields that addresses this complexity. The central elements of MAD are a modular classification of all relevant data and a new concept called "anchors." Data types are classified by the way they relate to the target variable, as either local or nonlocal and as either direct or indirect. Anchors are devices for localization of data: they are used to convert nonlocal, indirect data into local distributions of the target variables. The target of the inversion is the derivation of the joint distribution of the anchors and structural parameters, conditional to all measurements, regardless of scale or frequency of measurement. The structural parameters describe large-scale trends of the target variable fields, whereas the anchors capture local inhomogeneities. Following inversion, the joint distribution of anchors and structural parameters is used for generating random fields of the target variable(s) that are conditioned on the nonlocal, indirect data through their anchor representation. We demonstrate MAD through a detailed case study that assimilates point measurements of the conductivity with head measurements from natural gradient flow. The resulting statistical distributions of the parameters are non-Gaussian. Similarly, the moments of the estimates of the hydraulic head are non-Gaussian. We provide an extended discussion of MAD vis {\`{a}} vis other inversion methods, including maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori with an emphasis on the differences between MAD and the pilot points method.

abstract = {The paper forms the second part of an introduction to the SHE, a physically-based, distributed catchment modelling system produced jointly by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, the British Institute of Hydrology and SOGREAH (France) with the financial support of the Commission of the European Communities. The SHE is physically-based in the sense that the hydrological processes of water movement are modelled either by finite difference representations of the partial differential equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation, or by empirical equations derived from independent experimental research. Spatial distribution of catchment parameters, rainfall input and hydrological response is achieved in the horizontal by an orthogonal grid network and in the vertical by a column of horizontal layers at each grid square. Each of the primary processes of the land phase of the hydrological cycle is modelled in a separate component as follows: interception, by the Rutter accounting procedure; evapotranspiration, by the Penman-Monteith equation; overland and channel flow, by simplifications of the St. Venant equations; unsaturated zone flow, by the one-dimensional Richards equation; saturated zone flow, by the two-dimensional Boussinesq equation; snowmelt, by an energy budget method. Overall control of the parallel running of the components and the information exchanges between them is managed by a FRAME component. Careful attention has been devoted to a modular construction so that improvements or additional components (e.g. water quality and sediment yield) can be added in the future. Considerable operating flexibility is provided through the ability to vary the level of sophistication of the calculation mode to match the availability or quality of the data.},

From a hydrological perspective, it is important to understand the movement of the various phases of water (gas, liquid and ice) during the freezing and thawing of near-surface soils. We present a new non-isothermal, single-component (water), three-phase formulation that treats air as an inactive component. This single component model works well and produces similar results to a more complete and computationally demanding two-component (air, water) formulation, and is able to reproduce results of previously published laboratory experiments. A proof-of-concept implementation in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code PFLOTRAN is summarized, and parallel performance of that implementation is demonstrated. When water vapor diffusion is considered, a large effect on soil moisture dynamics is seen, which is due to dependence of thermal conductivity on ice content. A large three-dimensional simulation (with around 6 million degrees of freedom) of seasonal freezing and thawing is also presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This systematic review considers how water quality and aquatic ecology models represent the phosphorus cycle. Although the focus is on phosphorus, many of the observations and discussion points here relate to aquatic ecosystem models in general. The review considers how models compare across domains of application, the degree to which current models are fit for purpose, how to choose between multiple alternative formulations, and how models might be improved. Lake and marine models have been gradually increasing in complexity, with increasing emphasis on inorganic processes and ecosystems. River models have remained simpler, but have been more rigorously assessed. Processes important in less eutrophic systems have often been neglected: these include the biogeochemistry of organic phosphorus, transformations associated with fluxes through soils and sediments, transfer rate-limited phosphorus uptake, and responses of plants to pulsed nutrient inputs. Arguments for and against increasing model complexity, physical and physiological realism are reviewed.},

The objectives of this study were to examine how subsurface lateral flow generated through soil pedons from cropped hillslopes and to quantify its contribution to nitrate loading in the streams through an agricultural catchment in the subtropical region of China. Profiles of soil water potential along hillslopes and stream hydro-chemographs in a trenched stream below a cropped hillslope and at the catchment outlet were simultaneously recorded during two rainstorm events. The dynamics of soil water potential showed positive matrix soil water potential over impermeable soil layer at 0.6 to 1.50 m depths during and after the storms, indicating soil water saturation and drainage processes along the hillslopes irrespective of land uses. The hydro-chemographs in the streams, one trenched below a cropped hillslope and one at the catchment outlet, showed that the concentrations of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus corresponded well to stream flow during the storm, while the nitrate concentration increased on the recession limbs of the hydrographs after the end of the storm. All the synchronous data revealed that nitrate was delivered from the cropped hillslope through subsurface lateral flow to the streams during and after the end of the rainstorms. A chemical mixing model based on electricity conductivity (EC) and H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} concentration was successfully established, particularly for the trenched stream. The results showed that the subsurface lateral flow accounted for 29{\%} to 45{\%} of total stream flow in the trenched stream, responsible for 86{\%} of total NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-N loss (or 26{\%} of total N loss), and for 5.7{\%} to 7.3{\%} of total stream flow at the catchment outlet, responsible for about 69{\%} of total NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-N loss (or 28{\%} of total N loss). The results suggest that subsurface lateral flow through hydraulically stratified soil pedons have to be paid more attention for controlling non-point source surface water pollution from intensive agricultural catchment particularly in the subtropical areas with great soil infiltration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Mcglynn1824,
abstract = {[1] We present a simple approach for quantifying the local contributions of hillslope area and riparian area along a stream network based on gridded digital elevation data. The method enables one to compute catchment characteristics such as the distribution of riparian and hillslope inputs to the stream network, the variation of riparian-area percentage along the stream network, and subcatchment area distributions. We applied the technique to the 280-ha Maimai research area in New Zealand. We found that 85{\%} of the catchment area contributed to streams with a local catchment area of {\textless}20 ha, whereas only 28{\%} of the riparian area was found along these small streams. The potential of riparian zones to buffer hillslope runoff depends partially on the size of the riparian zone relative to the adjacent hillslope or upland area. Our approach enables calculation of a spatially distributed measure of riparian to hillslope area ratios. At the 280 ha Maimai research area we found that the ratio between riparian and hillslope area was 0.14. When we calculated this ''buffer capacity'' for each 20 m stream reach along the stream network, the values were below 0.14 for 75{\%} of the stream length and the median was 0.06. Using the catchment-wide ratio would thus significantly overestimate the ''effective'' riparian-to-hillslope-area ratio.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.},

abstract = {The hyporheic corridor (HC) encompasses the river–groundwater continuum, where the mixing of groundwater (GW) with river water (RW) in the HC can stimulate biogeochemical activity. Here we propose a novel thermodynamic mechanism underlying this phenomenon and reveal broader impacts on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial ecology. We show that thermodynamically favorable DOC accumulates in GW despite lower DOC concentration, and that RW contains thermodynamically less-favorable DOC, but at higher concentrations. This indicates that GW DOC is protected from microbial oxidation by low total energy within the DOC pool, whereas RW DOC is protected by lower thermodynamic favorability of carbon species. We propose that GW–RW mixing overcomes these protections and stimulates respiration. Mixing models coupled with geophysical and molecular analyses further reveal tipping points in spatiotemporal dynamics of DOC and indicate important hydrology–biochemistry–microbial feedbacks. Previously unrecognized thermodynamic mechanisms regulated by GW–RW mixing may therefore strongly influence biogeochemical and microbial dynamics in riverine ecosystems.},

After a brief introduction to the code's parallel layout and code design, PFLOTRAN's parallel performance (measured through strong and weak scalability analyses) is evaluated in the context of conceptual model layout, software and algorithmic design, and known hardware limitations. PFLOTRAN scales well (with regard to strong scaling) for three realistic problem scenarios: (1) in situ leaching of copper from a mineral ore deposit within a 5-spot flow regime, (2) transient flow and solute transport within a regional doublet, and (3) a real-world problem involving uranium surface complexation within a heterogeneous and extremely dynamic variably saturated flow field. Weak scalability is discussed in detail for the regional doublet problem, and several difficulties with its interpretation are noted.},

The Lake Taihu region in China has a dense river network and heavy N pollution; however, the capacity for permanent N removal by the river network is unknown. Here, we concurrently examined environmental factors and net N2 flux from sediments of two rivers in the Lake Taihu region between July 2012 and May 2013, using membrane inlet mass spectrometry, and then established a regression model incorporating the highly correlated factors to predict the N removal capacity of the river network in the region. To test the applicability of the regression model, 21 additional rivers surrounding Lake Taihu were sampled between ...},

We compared the predicted soil evaporation efficiency with those from several field and laboratory soil evaporation measurements and found good agreement with the typically observed two-stage soil evaporation curves. Comparison with the soil evaporation efficiency equation of Lee and Pielke (1992; hereafter LP92) indicates that their equation can overestimate soil evaporation when the atmospheric resistance is low and underestimate soil evaporation when the soil is dry. Using a synthetic inversion experiment, we demonstrated that using inverted soil resistance data from field measurements to derive empirical soil resistance formulations resulted in large uncertainty because (1) the inverted soil resistance data are always severely impacted by measurement error and (2) the derived empirical equation is very sensitive to the number of data points and the assumed functional form of the resistance. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We expect the application of our new TBC in land models will provide a consistent representation for the diffusive tracer exchange at the soil–air interface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, understanding biogeochemical cycling and microbial interactions in this ecotone is fundamental to understanding biogeochemical cycling at the aquatic–terrestrial interface and to creating robust hydrobiogeochemical models of dynamic river corridors. We aimed to (i) characterize biogeochemical and microbial differences in the parafluvial hyporheic zone across a small spatial domain (6 lateral meters) that spans a breadth of inundation histories and (ii) examine how parafluvial hyporheic sediments respond to laboratory-simulated re-inundation. Surface sediment was collected at four elevations along transects perpendicular to flow of the Columbia River, eastern WA, USA. The sediments were inundated by the river 0, 13, 127, and 398 days prior to sampling. Spatial variation in environmental variables (organic matter, moisture, nitrate, glucose, {\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, {\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}N) and microbial communities (16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR) were driven by differences in inundation history. Microbial respiration did not differ significantly across inundation histories prior to forced inundation in laboratory incubations. Forced inundation suppressed microbial respiration across all histories, but the degree of suppression was dramatically different between the sediments saturated and unsaturated at the time of sample collection, indicating a binary threshold response to re-inundation. We present a conceptual model in which irregular hydrologic fluctuations facilitate microbial communities adapted to local conditions and a relatively high flux of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. Upon rewetting, microbial communities are initially suppressed metabolically, which results in lower CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} flux rates primarily due to suppression of fungal respiration. Following prolonged inundation, the microbial community adapts to saturation by shifting composition, and the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} flux rebounds to prior levels due to the subsequent change in respiration. Our results indicate that the time between inundation events can push the system into alternate states: we suggest (i) that, above some threshold of inundation interval, re-inundation suppresses respiration to a consistent, low rate and (ii) that, below some inundation interval, re-inundation has a minor effect on respiration. Extending reactive transport models to capture processes that govern such dynamics will provide more robust predictions of river corridor biogeochemical function under altered surface water flow regimes in both managed and natural watersheds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {With enhanced data availability, distributed watershed models for large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly used to understand water budgets and examine effects of human activities and climate change/variability on water resources. Developing parallel computing software to improve calibration efficiency has received growing attention of the watershed modeling community as it is very time demanding to run iteratively complex models for calibration. In this research, we introduce a Python-based parallel computing package, PP-SWAT, for efficient calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This software employs Python, MPI for Python (mpi4py) and OpenMPI to parallelize A Multi-method Genetically Adaptive Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (AMALGAM), allowing for simultaneously addressing multiple objectives in calibrating SWAT. Test results on a Linux computer cluster showed that PP-SWAT can achieve a speedup of 45-109 depending on model complexity. Increasing the processor count beyond a certain threshold does not necessarily improve efficiency, because intensified resource competition may result in an I/O bottleneck. The efficiency achieved by PP-SWAT also makes it practical to implement multiple parameter adjustment schemes operating at different scales in affordable time, which helps provide SWAT users with a wider range of options of parameter sets to choose from for model(s) selection. PP-SWAT was not designed to address errors associated with other sources (e.g. model structure) and cautious supervision of its power should be exercised in order to attain physically meaningful calibration results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {[1] The problems of identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure remain outstanding research challenges for the discipline of hydrology. Progress on these problems requires understanding of the nature of differences between models. This paper presents a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures: the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE). FUSE was used to construct 79 unique model structures by combining components of 4 existing hydrological models. These new models were used to simulate streamflow in two of the basins used in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX): the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina). Results show that the new models produced simulations of streamflow that were at least as good as the simulations produced by the models that participated in the MOPEX experiment. Our initial application of the FUSE method for the Guadalupe River exposed relationships between model structure and model performance, suggesting that the choice of model structure is just as important as the choice of model parameters. However, further work is needed to evaluate model simulations using multiple criteria to diagnose the relative importance of model structural differences in various climate regimes and to assess the amount of independent information in each of the models. This work will be crucial to both identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure. To facilitate research on these problems, the FORTRAN-90 source code for FUSE is available upon request from the lead author.},

abstract = {TOUGHREACT is a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive non-isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media. The program was written in Fortran 77 and developed by introducing reactive geochemistry into the multiphase fluid and heat flow simulator TOUGH2. A variety of subsurface thermo-physical–chemical processes are considered under a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, ionic strength, and pH and Eh. Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability. The program can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic, and weathering processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. Here we present two examples to illustrate applicability of the program. The first example deals with injectivity effects of mineral scaling in a fractured geothermal reservoir. A major concern in the development of hot dry rock and hot fractured rock reservoirs is achieving and maintaining adequate injectivity, while avoiding the development of preferential short-circuiting flow paths. Rock–fluid interactions and associated mineral dissolution and precipitation effects could have a major impact on the long-term performance of these reservoirs. We used recent European studies as a starting point to explore chemically induced effects of fluid circulation in the geothermal systems. We examine ways in which the chemical composition of reinjected waters can be modified to improve reservoir performance by maintaining or even enhancing injectivity. The second TOUGHREACT application example is related to CO2 geologic sequestration in a saline aquifer. We performed numerical simulations for a commonly encountered Gulf Coast sediment under CO2 injection conditions in order to analyze the impact of CO2 immobilization through carbonate precipitation. Using the data presented in this paper, the CO2 mineral-trapping capability after 10,000 years can reach 60kg/m3 of sandstone by secondary carbonate mineral precipitation such as siderite, ankerite, and dawsonite. Most of the simulated mineral alteration pattern is consistent with the field observations of natural CO2 reservoirs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} A fully coupled three-dimensional surface and subsurface land model is developed and applied to a site along the Columbia River to simulate three-way interactions among river water, groundwater, and land surface processes. The model features the coupling of the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and a massively parallel multiphysics reactive transport model (PFLOTRAN). The coupled model, named CP v1.0, is applied to a 400{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m × 400{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m study domain instrumented with groundwater monitoring wells along the Columbia River shoreline. CP v1.0 simulations are performed at three spatial resolutions (i.e., 2, 10, and 20{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m) over a 5-year period to evaluate the impact of hydroclimatic conditions and spatial resolution on simulated variables. Results show that the coupled model is capable of simulating groundwater–river-water interactions driven by river stage variability along managed river reaches, which are of global significance as a result of over 30{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}000 dams constructed worldwide during the past half-century. Our numerical experiments suggest that the land-surface energy partitioning is strongly modulated by groundwater–river-water interactions through expanding the periodically inundated fraction of the riparian zone, and enhancing moisture availability in the vadose zone via capillary rise in response to the river stage change. Meanwhile, CLM4.5 fails to capture the key hydrologic process (i.e., groundwater–river-water exchange) at the site, and consequently simulates drastically different water and energy budgets. Furthermore, spatial resolution is found to significantly impact the accuracy of estimated the mass exchange rates at the boundaries of the aquifer, and it becomes critical when surface and subsurface become more tightly coupled with groundwater table within 6 to 7 meters below the surface. Inclusion of lateral subsurface flow influenced both the surface energy budget and subsurface transport processes as a result of river-water intrusion into the subsurface in response to an elevated river stage that increased soil moisture for evapotranspiration and suppressed available energy for sensible heat in the warm season. The coupled model developed in this study can be used for improving mechanistic understanding of ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling along river corridors under historical and future hydroclimatic changes. The dataset presented in this study can also serve as a good benchmarking case for testing other integrated models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract This paper provides a discussion of the development and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to flow forecasting in two flood-prone UK catchments using real hydrometric data. Given relatively brief calibration data sets it was possible to construct robust models of 15-min flows with six hour lead times for the Rivers Amber and Mole. Comparisons were made between the performance of the ANN and those of conventional flood forecasting systems. The results obtained for validation forecasts were of comparable quality to those obtained from operational systems for the River Amber. The ability of the ANN to cope with missing data and to “learn” from the event currently being forecast in real time makes it an appealing alternative to conventional lumped or semi-distributed flood forecasting models. However, further research is required to determine the optimum ANN training period for a given catchment, season and hydrological contexts.},

abstract = {Watershed models have been widely used for creating the scientific basis for management decisions regarding nonpoint source pollution. In this study, we evaluated the current state of watershed scale, spatially distributed, process-based, water quality modeling of nutrient pollution. Beginning from 1992, the year when Beven and Binley published their seminal paper on uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling, and ending in 2010, we selected 257 scientific publications which (i) employed spatially distributed modeling approaches at a watershed scale; (ii) provided predictions of flow, nutrient/sediment concentrations or loads; and (iii) reported fit to measured data. Most "best practices" (optimization, validation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis) are not consistently employed during model development. There are no statistically significant differences in model performance among land uses. Studies which used more than one point in space to evaluate their distributed models had significantly lower median values of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (0.70 vs 0.56, p{\textless}0.005, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test), and r2 (p{\textless}0.005). This finding suggests that model calibration only to the basin outlet may mask compensation of positive and negative errors of source and transportation processes. We conclude by advocating a number of new directions for distributed watershed modeling, including in-depth uncertainty analysis and the use of additional information, not necessarily related to model end points, to constrain parameter estimation.},

abstract = {Redox gradients within hyporheic zones significantly impact the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. To investigate the effect of these redox gradients on nitrogen transformation in the subsurface, we integrated a genome-informed complex reaction network into PFLOTRAN, which is an open source, massively parallel, three-dimensional, reactive flow and transport code. This study was conducted in the lower East River catchment in southwestern Colorado. The lower East River has multiple river meanders extending over a distance of 11km in rolling to mountainous region of the East Taylor watershed. We carried out reactive flow and transport simulations within two stream meanders to describe the biogeochemical zonation that evolves due to upwelling of nutrient rich groundwater and downwelling of oxygen rich stream. The specific objectives were to examine (1) the effect of hyporheic flow on biogeochemical zonation and (2) how meanders affect local nitrogen fluxes and transformation. Simulation results demonstrate that hyporheic flow paths within intra-meander regions lead to lateral redox zonation, which significantly impact nitrogen export into the stream system. Also, meander-driven hyporheic flow paths enhance denitrification rates because of the extended hyporheic region.},

abstract = {The links between soil water movement at the plot scale and runoff generation at the hillslope scale are highly non-linear and still not well understood. As such, a framework for the general characterization of hillslopes is still lacking. Here we present a number of virtual experiments with a 3D physically-based finite element model to systematically investigate the interactions between some of the dominant controls on subsurface stormflow generation. We used the well-studied Panola experimental hillslope to test our base case simulation and used the surface and subsurface topography and the stormflow data of this site as a framework for a subsequent series of virtual experiments. The parameterization of the soil and bedrock properties was based on field measurements of soil moisture and saturated hydraulic conductivity. After calibration and testing against multiple evaluation criteria including distributed trench flow data and internal tensiometric response, we varied slope angle, soil depth, storm size and bedrock permeability across multiple ranges to establish a set of response surfaces for several hillslope flow metrics. We found that connectivity of subsurface saturation was a unifying descriptor of hillslope behavior across the many combinations of slope type. While much of the interplay between our four hillslope variables was intuitive, several interactions in variable combinations were found. Our analysis indicated that, e.g. interactions between slope angle, soil depth and storm size that caused unexpected behavior of hydrograph peak times were the result of the interplay between subsurface topography and the overlying soil mantle with its spatially varying soil depth distribution. Those interactions led to new understanding of process controls on connectivity .},

@article{Jackson-Blakea,
abstract = {Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scot-land. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (pro-totype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated. Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.},

abstract = {Predicting and controlling the concentrations of redox-sensitive elements are primary concerns for environmental remediation of contaminated sites. These predictions are complicated by dynamic flow processes as hydrologic variability is a governing control on conservative and reactive chemical concentrations. Subsurface heterogeneity in the form of layers and lenses further complicates the flow dynamics of the system impacting chemical concentrations including redox-sensitive elements. In response to these complexities, this study investigates the role of heterogeneity and hydrologic processes in an effective parameter upscaling scheme from the column to the landfill scale. We used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to derive upscaling coefficients for hydrological and geochemical parameters, which were tested for variations across heterogeneous systems (layers and lenses) and interaction of flow processes based on the output uncertainty of dominant biogeochemical concentrations at the Norman Landfill site, a closed municipal landfill with prevalent organic and trace metal contamination. The results from MCMC analysis indicated that geochemical upscaling coefficients based on effective concentration ratios incorporating local heterogeneity across layered and lensed systems produced better estimates of redox-sensitive biogeochemistry at the field scale. MCMC analysis also suggested that inclusion of hydrological parameters in the upscaling scheme reduced the output uncertainty of effective mean geochemical concentrations by orders of magnitude at the Norman Landfill site. This was further confirmed by posterior density plots of the scaling coefficients that revealed unimodal characteristics when only geochemical processes were involved, but produced multimodal distributions when hydrological parameters were included. The multimodality again suggests the effect of heterogeneity and lithologic variability on the distribution of redox-sensitive elements at the Norman Landfill site.},

@article{Rubin2010,
abstract = {[1] This paper addresses the inverse problem in spatially variable fields such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater aquifers or rainfall intensity in hydrology. Common to all these problems is the existence of a complex pattern of spatial variability of the target variables and observations, the multiple sources of data available for characterizing the fields, the complex relations between the observed and target variables and the multiple scales and frequencies of the observations. The method of anchored distributions (MAD) that we propose here is a general Bayesian method of inverse modeling of spatial random fields that addresses this complexity. The central elements of MAD are a modular classification of all relevant data and a new concept called "anchors." Data types are classified by the way they relate to the target variable, as either local or nonlocal and as either direct or indirect. Anchors are devices for localization of data: they are used to convert nonlocal, indirect data into local distributions of the target variables. The target of the inversion is the derivation of the joint distribution of the anchors and structural parameters, conditional to all measurements, regardless of scale or frequency of measurement. The structural parameters describe large-scale trends of the target variable fields, whereas the anchors capture local inhomogeneities. Following inversion, the joint distribution of anchors and structural parameters is used for generating random fields of the target variable(s) that are conditioned on the nonlocal, indirect data through their anchor representation. We demonstrate MAD through a detailed case study that assimilates point measurements of the conductivity with head measurements from natural gradient flow. The resulting statistical distributions of the parameters are non-Gaussian. Similarly, the moments of the estimates of the hydraulic head are non-Gaussian. We provide an extended discussion of MAD vis {\`{a}} vis other inversion methods, including maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori with an emphasis on the differences between MAD and the pilot points method.

@article{Weiler2004,
abstract = {We present an approach for process conceptualization in hillslope hydrology. We develop and implement a series of virtual experiments, whereby the interaction between water flow pathways, source and mixing at the hillslope scale is examined within a virtual experiment framework. We define these virtual experiments as ‘numerical experiments with a model driven by collective field intelligence'. The virtual experiments explore the first-order controls in hillslope hydrology, where the experimentalist and modeler work together to cooperatively develop and analyze the results. Our hillslope model for the virtual experiments (HillVi) in this paper is based on conceptualizing the water balance within the saturated and unsaturated zone in relation to soil physical properties in a spatially explicit manner at the hillslope scale. We argue that a virtual experiment model needs to be able to capture all major controls on subsurface flow processes that the experimentalist might deem important, while at the same time being simple with few ‘tunable parameters'. This combination makes the approach, and the dialog between experimentalist and modeler, a useful hypothesis testing tool. HillVi simulates mass flux for different initial conditions under the same flow conditions. We analyze our results in terms of an artificial line source and isotopic hydrograph separation of water and subsurface flow. Our results for this first set of virtual experiments showed how drainable porosity and soil depth variability exert a first order control on flow and transport at the hillslope scale. We found that high drainable porosity soils resulted in a restricted water table rise, resulting in more pronounced channeling of lateral subsurface flow along the soil–bedrock interface. This in turn resulted in a more anastomosing network of tracer movement across the slope. The virtual isotope hydrograph separation showed higher proportions of event water with increasing drainable porosity. When combined with previous experimental findings and conceptualizations, virtual experiments can be an effective way to isolate certain controls and examine their influence over a range of rainfall and antecedent wetness conditions.},

@article{Chen2012,
abstract = {The heat pulse method is widely used to measure water flux through plants; it works by using the speed at which a heat pulse is propagated through the system to infer the velocity of water through a porous medium. No systematic, non-destructive calibration procedure exists to determine the site-specific parameters necessary for calculating sap velocity, e.g., wood thermal diffusivity and probe spacing. Such parameter calibration is crucial to obtain the correct transpiration flux density from the sap flow measurements at the plant scale and subsequently to upscale tree-level water fluxes to canopy and landscape scales. The purpose of this study is to present a statistical framework for sampling and simultaneously estimating the tree's thermal diffusivity and probe spacing from in situ heat response curves collected by the implanted probes of a heat ratio measurement device. Conditioned on the time traces of wood temperature following a heat pulse, the parameters are inferred using a Bayesian inversion technique, based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The primary advantage of the proposed methodology is that it does not require knowledge of probe spacing or any further intrusive sampling of sapwood. The Bayesian framework also enables direct quantification of uncertainty in estimated sap flow velocity. Experiments using synthetic data show that repeated tests using the same apparatus are essential for obtaining reliable and accurate solutions. When applied to field conditions, these tests can be obtained in different seasons and can be automated using the existing data logging system. Empirical factors are introduced to account for the influence of non-ideal probe geometry on the estimation of heat pulse velocity, and are estimated in this study as well. The proposed methodology may be tested for its applicability to realistic field conditions, with an ultimate goal of calibrating heat ratio sap flow systems in practical applications.},

In this study, we explore the ability of deep neural networks to fill in gaps in spatially distributed time-series data. We selected a location at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford site to demonstrate and evaluate the new method, using a 10-year spatio-temporal hydrological dataset of temperature, specific conductance, and groundwater table elevation from 42 wells that monitor the dynamic and heterogeneous hydrologic exchanges between the Columbia River and its adjacent groundwater aquifer. We employ a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture, which is specially designed to address both spatial and temporal variations in the property fields. The performance of gap filling using an LSTM framework is evaluated using test datasets with synthetic data gaps created by assuming the observations were missing for a given time window (i.e., gap length), such that the mean absolute percentage error can be calculated against true observations. Such test datasets also allow us to examine how well the original nonlinear dynamics are captured in gap-filled time series beyond the error statistics. The performance of the LSTM-based gap-filling method is compared to that of a traditional, popular gap-filling method: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Although ARIMA appears to perform slightly better than LSTM on average error statistics, LSTM is better able to capture nonlinear dynamics that are present in time series. Thus, LSTMs show promising potential to outperform ARIMA for gap filling in highly dynamic time-series observations characterized by multiple dominant modes of variability. Capturing such dynamics is essential to generate the most valuable observations to advance our understanding of dynamic complex systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Existing land surface models (LSMs) describe physical and biological processes that occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, biogeochemical and hydrological processes responsible for carbon (CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) exchanges with the atmosphere range from the molecular scale (pore-scale O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} consumption) to tens of kilometers (vegetation distribution, river networks). Additionally, many processes within LSMs are nonlinearly coupled (e.g., methane production and soil moisture dynamics), and therefore simple linear upscaling techniques can result in large prediction error. In this paper we applied a reduced-order modeling (ROM) technique known as "proper orthogonal decomposition mapping method" that reconstructs temporally resolved fine-resolution solutions based on coarse-resolution solutions. We developed four different methods and applied them to four study sites in a polygonal tundra landscape near Barrow, Alaska. Coupled surface–subsurface isothermal simulations were performed for summer months (June–September) at fine (0.25 m) and coarse (8 m) horizontal resolutions. We used simulation results from three summer seasons (1998–2000) to build ROMs of the 4-D soil moisture field for the study sites individually (single-site) and aggregated (multi-site). The results indicate that the ROM produced a significant computational speedup ({\textgreater} 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) with very small relative approximation error ({\textless} 0.1{\%}) for 2 validation years not used in training the ROM. We also demonstrate that our approach: (1) efficiently corrects for coarse-resolution model bias and (2) can be used for polygonal tundra sites not included in the training data set with relatively good accuracy ({\textless} 1.7{\%} relative error), thereby allowing for the possibility of applying these ROMs across a much larger landscape. By coupling the ROMs constructed at different scales together hierarchically, this method has the potential to efficiently increase the resolution of land models for coupled climate simulations to spatial scales consistent with mechanistic physical process representation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Ye2004,
abstract = {[1] Hydrologic analyses typically rely on a single conceptual-mathematical model. Yet hydrologic environments are open and complex, rendering them prone to multiple interpretations and mathematical descriptions. Adopting only one of these may lead to statistical bias and underestimation of uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) [Hoeting et al., 1999] provides an optimal way to combine the predictions of several competing models and to assess their joint predictive uncertainty. However, it tends to be computationally demanding and relies heavily on prior information about model parameters. Neuman [2002, 2003] proposed a maximum likelihood version (MLBMA) of BMA to render it computationally feasible and to allow dealing with cases where reliable prior information is lacking. We apply MLBMA to seven alternative variogram models of log air permeability data from single-hole pneumatic injection tests in six boreholes at the Apache Leap Research Site (ALRS) in central Arizona. Unbiased ML estimates of variogram and drift parameters are obtained using adjoint state maximum likelihood cross validation [Samper and Neuman, 1989a] in conjunction with universal kriging and generalized least squares. Standard information criteria provide an ambiguous ranking of the models, which does not justify selecting one of them and discarding all others as is commonly done in practice. Instead, we eliminate some of the models based on their negligibly small posterior probabilities and use the rest to project the measured log permeabilities by kriging onto a rock volume containing the six boreholes. We then average these four projections and associated kriging variances, using the posterior probability of each model as weight. Finally, we cross validate the results by eliminating from consideration all data from one borehole at a time, repeating the above process and comparing the predictive capability of MLBMA with that of each individual model. We find that MLBMA is superior to any individual geostatistical model of log permeability among those we consider at the ALRS.},

The objectives of this study were to examine how subsurface lateral flow generated through soil pedons from cropped hillslopes and to quantify its contribution to nitrate loading in the streams through an agricultural catchment in the subtropical region of China. Profiles of soil water potential along hillslopes and stream hydro-chemographs in a trenched stream below a cropped hillslope and at the catchment outlet were simultaneously recorded during two rainstorm events. The dynamics of soil water potential showed positive matrix soil water potential over impermeable soil layer at 0.6 to 1.50 m depths during and after the storms, indicating soil water saturation and drainage processes along the hillslopes irrespective of land uses. The hydro-chemographs in the streams, one trenched below a cropped hillslope and one at the catchment outlet, showed that the concentrations of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus corresponded well to stream flow during the storm, while the nitrate concentration increased on the recession limbs of the hydrographs after the end of the storm. All the synchronous data revealed that nitrate was delivered from the cropped hillslope through subsurface lateral flow to the streams during and after the end of the rainstorms. A chemical mixing model based on electricity conductivity (EC) and H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} concentration was successfully established, particularly for the trenched stream. The results showed that the subsurface lateral flow accounted for 29{\%} to 45{\%} of total stream flow in the trenched stream, responsible for 86{\%} of total NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-N loss (or 26{\%} of total N loss), and for 5.7{\%} to 7.3{\%} of total stream flow at the catchment outlet, responsible for about 69{\%} of total NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-N loss (or 28{\%} of total N loss). The results suggest that subsurface lateral flow through hydraulically stratified soil pedons have to be paid more attention for controlling non-point source surface water pollution from intensive agricultural catchment particularly in the subtropical areas with great soil infiltration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {[1] Groundwater can serve as an important resource for woody vegetation in semiarid landscapes, particularly when soil water is functionally depleted and unavailable to plants. This study examines the uptake of groundwater by deciduous blue oak trees (Quercus douglasii) in a California oak savanna. Here we present a suite of direct and indirect methods that demonstrate its occurrence and quantify its rates. The study site is underlain by a thin soil layer and fractured metavolcanic bedrock. Typical depth to groundwater is approximately 8 m. A variety of water storage and flux measurements were collected from 2005 to 2008, including groundwater levels, soil moisture contents, sap flows, and latent heat fluxes. During the dry season, groundwater uptake rates ranged from 4 to 25 mm month −1 and approximately 80{\%} of total ET during June, July, and August came from groundwater. Leaf and soil water potentials supported these results, indicating that groundwater uptake was thermodynamically favorable over soil water uptake for key portions of the growing season. These findings strongly suggest that blue oaks should be considered obligate phreatophytes and that groundwater reserves provide a buffer to rapid changes in their hydroclimate, if these assets are not otherwise depleted by prolonged drought or human consumption. While groundwater uptake may provide for short-term protection, it should be viewed not as a mechanism for continued plant growth. It allows the woody vegetation to subsist during the summer but not to flourish.},

abstract = {The paper forms the first part of an introduction to the SHE, a physically-based, distributed, catchment modelling system produced jointly by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, the British Institute of Hydrology and SOGREAH (France) with the financial support of the Commission of the European Communities. The SHE developed from the perception that conventional rainfall/runoff models are inappropriate to many pressing hydrological problems, especially those related to the impact of man's activities on land-use change and water quality. Only through the use of models which have a physical basis and allow for spatial variations within a catchment can these problems be tackled. The physical basis and flexible operating structure of the SHE allows the model to use as many or as few data as are available and also to incorporate data on topography, vegetation and soil properties not normally included in catchment models. It does not require a lengthy hydrometeorological record for its calibration and its distributed nature enables the spatial variability in catchment inputs and outputs to be simulated. However, the large amount of data required by the model means that new operation methodologies must be evolved. Thus spatial scale effects or simply a lack of data may create significant uncertainties in the values of the catchment parameters used in a simulation. These uncertainties will give rise to corresponding uncertainties in the predictions. However, the SHE is able to quantify these uncertainties by carrying out sensitivity analyses for realistic ranges of the parameter values. Even when there is a lack of data, therefore, the SHE can act as a valuable “decision-support system”.},

abstract = {The need to understand potential climate impacts and feedbacks in Arctic regions has prompted recent interest in modeling of permafrost dynamics in a warming climate. A new fine-scale integrated surface/subsurface thermal hydrology modeling capability is described and demonstrated in proof-of-concept simulations. The new modeling capability combines a surface energy balance model with recently developed three-dimensional subsurface thermal hydrology models and new models for noniso-thermal surface water flows and snow distribution in the microtopography. Surface water flows are mod-eled using the diffusion wave equation extended to include energy transport and phase change of ponded water. Variation of snow depth in the microtopography, physically the result of wind scour, is modeled phenomenologically with a diffusion wave equation. The multiple surface and subsurface processes are implemented by leveraging highly parallel community software. Fully integrated thermal hydrology simulations on the tilted open book catchment, an important test case for integrated surface/ subsurface flow modeling, are presented. Fine-scale 100 year projections of the integrated permafrost thermal hydrological system on an ice wedge polygon at Barrow Alaska in a warming climate are also presented. These simulations demonstrate the feasibility of microtopography-resolving, process-rich simulations as a tool to help understand possible future evolution of the carbon-rich Arctic tundra in a warming climate.},

We also tested 16 system attributes hypothesized to explain the negative relationship between soil moisture mean and variance toward the wetter end of the distribution and found that, in the model, 59{\%} of the variance of this relationship can be explained by the elevation gradient convolved with mean evapotranspiration. We did not find significant relationships between the time rate of change of soil moisture variance and covariances between mean moisture and evapotranspiration, drainage, or soil properties, as has been reported in other modeling studies. As seen in previous observational studies, the predicted soil moisture skewness was predominantly positive and negative in drier and wetter regions, respectively. In individual coarse-resolution grid cells, the transition between positive and negative skewness occurred at a mean soil moisture of {\~{}}0.25–0.3. The type of numerical modeling experiments presented here can improve understanding of the causes of soil moisture heterogeneity across scales, and inform the types of observations required to more accurately represent what is often unresolved spatial heterogeneity in regional and global hydrological models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Hydrochemical solute concentrations in the shallow subsurface can be spatially highly variable within small scales, particularly at interfaces. However, most monitoring systems fail to capture these small scale variations. Within this study, we developed a high resolution multilevel well (HR-MLW) with which we monitored water across the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zone with a vertical resolution of 0.05-0.5 m. We installed three of these 4 m deep HR-MLWs in the riparian zone of a third-order river and analyzed for hydrochemical parameters and stable water isotopes. The results showed three distinct vertical zones (unsaturated zone, upper saturated zone, lower saturated zone) within the alluvial aquifer. A 2 m thick layer influenced by river water (upper saturated zone) was not captured by existing monitoring wells with higher screen length. Hydrochemical data (isotopes, total ions) were consistent in all HR-MLWs and showed similar variation over time emphasizing the reliability of the installed monitoring system. Further, the depths zones were also reflected in the NO3-N concentrations; with high spatial variabilities between the three wells. The zonation was constant over time, with seasonal variability in the upper saturated zone due to the influence of river water. This study highlights the use of high resolution monitoring for identifying the spatial and temporal variability of hydrochemical parameters present in many aquifer systems. Possible applications range from riparian zones, agricultural field sites to contaminated site studies, wherever an improved understanding of biogeochemical turnover processes is necessary.},

abstract = {[1] Enhanced consideration of the hydrogeomorphic template of watersheds is critical to understanding watershed nitrogen budgets. We developed a framework to estimate the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of soil moisture and soil oxygen in surficial soils to scale nitrogen transformations for a forested watershed (Pond Branch) in Maryland, USA. We sampled soil cores in upland, hillslope hollow, riparian hollow, and riparian hummock landscape positions in different seasons for biogeochemical fluxes including measurement of N 2 gas produced via denitrification. We extrapolated these rates in space and time with information derived from in situ soil oxygen and soil moisture probes to scale fluxes from plots to the catchment level. We addressed three questions: (1) How important are seasonal, daily, and storm event variations in soil oxygen for denitrification? (2) How is denitrification spatially distributed through the watershed? (3) How important is denitrification to the watershed nitrogen budget? We found that microtopography within the riparian zone is a significant influence on soil oxygen dynamics and therefore redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes such as denitrification. Riparian zone hollows (lower topographic positions) represented 0.5{\%}-1.0{\%} of the catchment area, but accounted for {\textgreater}99{\%} of total denitrification. Interestingly, topography was a much stronger controller of oxygen than rainfall, which had little influence on temporal variation in soil oxygen levels. Spatial and temporal extrapolations of measured rates suggest that a minimum of 16{\%}-27{\%} of atmospheric nitrogen deposition is lost to denitrification. These results suggest that the importance of denitrification in the nitrogen budget of forested watersheds depends fundamentally on the presence of landscape elements, such as riparian hollows that function as "hot spots" of activity.

abstract = {Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scot-land. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (pro-totype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated. Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Long-term spatio-temporal changes in subsurface hydrological flow are usually quantified through a network of wells; however, such observations often are spatially sparse and temporal gaps exist due to poor quality or instrument failure. In this study, we explore the ability of deep neural networks to fill in gaps in spatially distributed time-series data. We selected a location at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford site to demonstrate and evaluate the new method, using a 10-year spatio-temporal hydrological dataset of temperature, specific conductance, and groundwater table elevation from 42 wells that monitor the dynamic and heterogeneous hydrologic exchanges between the Columbia River and its adjacent groundwater aquifer. We employ a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture, which is specially designed to address both spatial and temporal variations in the property fields. The performance of gap filling using an LSTM framework is evaluated using test datasets with synthetic data gaps created by assuming the observations were missing for a given time window (i.e., gap length), such that the mean absolute percentage error can be calculated against true observations. Such test datasets also allow us to examine how well the original nonlinear dynamics are captured in gap-filled time series beyond the error statistics. The performance of the LSTM-based gap-filling method is compared to that of a traditional, popular gap-filling method: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Although ARIMA appears to perform slightly better than LSTM on average error statistics, LSTM is better able to capture nonlinear dynamics that are present in time series. Thus, LSTMs show promising potential to outperform ARIMA for gap filling in highly dynamic time-series observations characterized by multiple dominant modes of variability. Capturing such dynamics is essential to generate the most valuable observations to advance our understanding of dynamic complex systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Developing an understanding of how groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) systems function and interact to impact water quantity, water quality, and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources, environmental protection, and land management. Although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades, there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating GW-SW interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues. For this reason, a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying, understanding, and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling GW-SW interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems. The framework identifies fundamental hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of GW-SW systems. The framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue. The framework focuses on streams, rivers, and lakes but can be adapted for use in other GW-SW settings such as ponds, wetlands, and coastal marine environments. Applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three GW-SW interaction settings in southern Ontario, Canada: a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the Pine River, discharge of groundwater nutrients to Lake Huron, and a regional-scale conceptualization of GW-SW flow interactions in the Duffins Creek watershed. The case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models, assess environmental issues, identify knowledge gaps, and provide a basis for designing site investigations.},

While numerical models that solve both surface and subsurface flow equations in a single framework (matrix) are increasingly being applied, computational limitations have restricted their use to local and regional studies. Regional or watershed-scale simulations have been effective tools for understanding hydrologic processes; however, there are still many questions, such as the adaptation of water resources to anthropogenic stressors and climate variability, that can only be answered across large spatial extents at high resolution. In response to this grand challenge in hydrology, we present the results of a parallel, integrated hydrologic model simulating surface and subsurface flow at high spatial resolution (1 km) over much of continental North America ({\~{}} 6.3 M km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). These simulations provide integrated predictions of hydrologic states and fluxes, namely, water table depth and streamflow, at very large scale and high resolution. The physics-based modeling approach used here requires limited parameterizations and relies only on more fundamental inputs such as topography, hydrogeologic properties and climate forcing. Results are compared to observations and provide mechanistic insight into hydrologic process interaction. This study demonstrates both the feasibility of continental-scale integrated models and their utility for improving our understanding of large-scale hydrologic systems; the combination of high resolution and large spatial extent facilitates analysis of scaling relationships using model outputs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Process management is enabled by viewing the system of equations as a tree, where individual equations are associated with leaf nodes and coupling strategies with internal nodes. A dynamically generated dependency graph connects a variable to its dependencies, streamlining and automating model evaluation, easing model development, and ensuring models are modular and flexible. Additionally, the dependency graph is used to ensure that data requirements are consistent between all processes in a given simulation.

abstract = {Three-dimensional numerical simulations using a detailed synthetic hydraulic conductivity field developed from geological considerations provide insight into the scaling of subsurface flow and transport processes. Flow and advective transport in the highly resolved heterogeneous field were modeled using massively parallel computers, providing a realistic baseline for evaluation of the impacts of parameter scaling. Upscaling of hydraulic conductivity was performed at a variety of scales using a flexible power law averaging technique. A series of tests were performed to determine the effects of varying the scaling exponent on a number of metrics of flow and transport behavior. Flow and transport simulation on high-performance computers and three-dimensional scientific visualization combine to form a powerful tool for gaining insight into the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems. Many quantitative groundwater models utilize upscaled hydraulic conductivity parameters, either implicitly or explicitly. These parameters are designed to reproduce the bulk flow characteristics at the grid or field scale while not requiring detailed quantification of local-scale conductivity variations. An example from applied groundwater modeling is the common practice of calibrating grid-scale model hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity parameters so as to approximate observed hydraulic head and boundary flux values. Such parameterizations, perhaps with a bulk dispersivity imposed, are then sometimes used to predict transport of reactive or non-reactive solutes. However, this work demonstrates that those parameters that lead to the best upscaling for hydraulic conductivity and head do not necessarily correspond to the best upscaling for prediction of a variety of transport behaviors. This result reflects the fact that transport is strongly impacted by the existence and connectedness of extreme-valued hydraulic conductivities, in contrast to bulk flow which depends more strongly on mean values. It provides motivation for continued research into upscaling methods for transport that directly address advection in heterogeneous porous media.

abstract = {[1] When predicting flow in the unsaturated zone, any method for modeling the flow will have to define how, and to what level, the subsurface structure is resolved. In this paper, we use the Ensemble Kalman Filter to assimilate local soil water content observations from both a synthetic layered lysimeter and a real field experiment in layered soil in an unsaturated water flow model. We investigate the use of colored noise bias corrections to account for unresolved subsurface layering in a homogeneous model and compare this approach with a fully resolved model. In both models, we use a simplified model parameterization in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The results show that the use of bias corrections can increase the predictive capability of a simplified homogeneous flow model if the bias corrections are applied to the model states. If correct knowledge of the layering structure is available, the fully resolved model performs best. However, if no, or erroneous, layering is used in the model, the use of a homogeneous model with bias corrections can be the better choice for modeling the behavior of the system.

Precipitation data at high spatial and temporal resolutions are crucial for basin-scale hydrological and meteorological studies. In this study, we propose a cumulative distribution of frequency (CDF)-based downscaling method (DCDF) to obtain hourly 0.05{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}∘{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}×{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.05{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}∘{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} precipitation data.

After a brief introduction to the code's parallel layout and code design, PFLOTRAN's parallel performance (measured through strong and weak scalability analyses) is evaluated in the context of conceptual model layout, software and algorithmic design, and known hardware limitations. PFLOTRAN scales well (with regard to strong scaling) for three realistic problem scenarios: (1) in situ leaching of copper from a mineral ore deposit within a 5-spot flow regime, (2) transient flow and solute transport within a regional doublet, and (3) a real-world problem involving uranium surface complexation within a heterogeneous and extremely dynamic variably saturated flow field. Weak scalability is discussed in detail for the regional doublet problem, and several difficulties with its interpretation are noted.},

abstract = {[1] This paper proposes a strategy for improving the computational efficiency of model inversion using the method of anchored distributions (MAD) by ''bundling'' similar model parametrizations in the likelihood function. Inferring the likelihood function typically requires a large number of forward model (FM) simulations for each possible model parametrization; as a result, the process is quite expensive. To ease this prohibitive cost, we present an approximation for the likelihood function called bundling that relaxes the requirement for high quantities of FM simulations. This approximation redefines the conditional statement of the likelihood function as the probability of a set of similar model parametrizations ''bundle'' replicating field measurements, which we show is neither a model reduction nor a sampling approach to improving the computational efficiency of model inversion. To evaluate the effectiveness of these modifications, we compare the quality of predictions and computational cost of bundling relative to a baseline MAD inversion of 3-D flow and transport model parameters. Additionally, to aid understanding of the implementation we provide a tutorial for bundling in the form of a sample data set and script for the R statistical computing language. For our synthetic experiment, bundling achieved a 35{\%} reduction in overall computational cost and had a limited negative impact on predicted probability distributions of the model parameters. Strategies for minimizing error in the bundling approximation, for enforcing similarity among the sets of model parametrizations, and for identifying convergence of the likelihood function are also presented.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Physically based models provide insights into key hydrologic processes but are associated with uncertainties due to deficiencies in forcing data, model parameters, and model structure. Forcing uncertainty is enhanced in snow-affected catchments, where weather stations are scarce and prone to measurement errors, and meteorological variables exhibit high variability. Hence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics affect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics are most important. Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how (1) different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), (2) different error probability distributions, and (3) different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative importance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest. Sensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter most for hydrologic modeling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Extreme floods in the Delaware River basin are examined through analyses of a sequence of record and near-record floods during September 2004, April 2005, and June 2006. The three flood episodes reflect three principal flood-generating mechanisms in the eastern United States: tropical cyclones (September 2004); late winter–early spring extratropical systems (April 2005); and warm-season convective systems (June 2006). Extreme flooding in the Delaware River basin is the product of heavy rainfall and runoff from high-gradient portions of the watershed. Orographic precipitation mechanisms play a central role in the extreme flood climatology of the Delaware River basin and, more generally, for the eastern United States. Extreme flooding for the 2004–06 events was produced in large measure from forested portions of the watershed. Analyses of flood frequency based on annual flood peak observations from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauging stations with “long” records illustrate the striking heterogeneity of flood response over the region, the important role of landfalling tropical cyclones for the upper tail of flood peak distributions, and the prevalence of nonstationarities in flood peak records. Analyses show that changepoints are a more common source of nonstationarity than linear time trends. Regulation by dams and reservoirs plays an important role in determining changepoints, but the downstream effects of reservoirs on flood distributions are limited.},

The investigation was carried out for an actual catchment topography as represented by Coweeta River experimental basin with synthetic realizations for rainfall and soils. The hydrologic response of this catchment was modeled by a modified version of topmodel★★Beven and Kirkby (1979) which is capable of modeling both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff and incorporating the spatial variability of soils, topography, and rainfall. The effect of scale was analyzed by first dividing the catchment into smaller subcatchments and determining the average water fluxes for each subcatchment. The preliminary results lead to the following conclusions: (1) a Representative Elementary Area (REA) exists in the context of catchment hydrologic responses; (2) the REA is strongly influenced by the topography; and (3) based on our initial results, the length scale of rainfall seems to have only a secondary role in determining the size of the REA; however, increases in the variability of rainfall and soils between subcatchments increase the variability of runoff generation between subcatchments.},

abstract = {1.Rivers and their catchments are complex, dynamic and non-equilibrium systems. Although the general functioning of these ecosystems is familiar, the characteristics of particular sites are often poorly known and accurate prediction of future behaviour to inform management decisions is extremely difficult. 2.Simple relationships between river nutrient concentrations and the health of river ecosystems do not exist. Natural variability and practical and technical constraints reduce our ability to set nutrient targets to protect river ecosystems. Particularly challenging is the use of simple dose-response relationships as regulatory threshold targets, whereby sections of river are classified as either passing or failing to meet good ecological status. 3.Ecologically meaningful frameworks are needed that take account of the epistemic uncertainty associated with our predictions. Such frameworks should have clearly defined goals; be holistic; allow for natural variability; help to define ecologically acceptable environmental regimes; recognise that significant uncertainties mean that we will often be using indices rather than absolute measures; and use measures that explicitly include uncertainty estimates. Such approaches allow those outside the decision-making process to understand the level of environmental precaution included in the management of complex systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.},

abstract = {This systematic review considers how water quality and aquatic ecology models represent the phosphorus cycle. Although the focus is on phosphorus, many of the observations and discussion points here relate to aquatic ecosystem models in general. The review considers how models compare across domains of application, the degree to which current models are fit for purpose, how to choose between multiple alternative formulations, and how models might be improved. Lake and marine models have been gradually increasing in complexity, with increasing emphasis on inorganic processes and ecosystems. River models have remained simpler, but have been more rigorously assessed. Processes important in less eutrophic systems have often been neglected: these include the biogeochemistry of organic phosphorus, transformations associated with fluxes through soils and sediments, transfer rate-limited phosphorus uptake, and responses of plants to pulsed nutrient inputs. Arguments for and against increasing model complexity, physical and physiological realism are reviewed.},

The aim of this work is to provide insight into the physical, chemical, and biological factors along with their interactions that are critical in the estimation of E. coli loads in surface streams. There are various models to predict E. coli loads in streams, but they tend to be system or site specific or overly complex without enhancing our understanding of these factors. Hence, based on available data, a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is presented for estimating E. coli loads based on physical, chemical, and biological factors in streams. The BNN has the dual advantage of overcoming the absence of quality data (with regards to consistency in data) and determination of mechanistic model parameters by employing a probabilistic framework. This study evaluates whether the BNN model can be an effective alternative tool to mechanistic models for E. coli loads estimation in streams. For this purpose, a comparison with a traditional model (LOADEST, USGS) is conducted. The models are compared for estimated E. coli loads based on available water quality data in Plum Creek, Texas. All the model efficiency measures suggest that overall E. coli loads estimations by the BNN model are better than the E. coli loads estimations by the LOADEST model on all the three occasions (three-fold cross validation). Thirteen factors were used for estimating E. coli loads with the exhaustive feature selection technique, which indicated that six of thirteen factors are important for estimating E. coli loads. Physical factors included temperature and dissolved oxygen; chemical factors include phosphate and ammonia; biological factors include suspended solids and chlorophyll. The results highlight that the LOADEST model estimates E. coli loads better in the smaller ranges, whereas the BNN model estimates E. coli loads better in the higher ranges. Hence, the BNN model can be used to design targeted monitoring programs and implement regulatory standards through TMDL programs.},

abstract = {[1] When predicting flow in the unsaturated zone, any method for modeling the flow will have to define how, and to what level, the subsurface structure is resolved. In this paper, we use the Ensemble Kalman Filter to assimilate local soil water content observations from both a synthetic layered lysimeter and a real field experiment in layered soil in an unsaturated water flow model. We investigate the use of colored noise bias corrections to account for unresolved subsurface layering in a homogeneous model and compare this approach with a fully resolved model. In both models, we use a simplified model parameterization in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The results show that the use of bias corrections can increase the predictive capability of a simplified homogeneous flow model if the bias corrections are applied to the model states. If correct knowledge of the layering structure is available, the fully resolved model performs best. However, if no, or erroneous, layering is used in the model, the use of a homogeneous model with bias corrections can be the better choice for modeling the behavior of the system.

abstract = {Keywords: Temporal Bayesian networks Causal independence models Clinical decision support Pregnancy disorders eHealth Home monitoring Bridging the gap between the theory of Bayesian networks and solving an actual problem is still a big challenge and this is in particular true for medical problems, where such a gap is clearly evident. We argue that Bayesian networks offer appropriate technology for the successful modelling of medical problems, including the personalisation of healthcare. Personalisation is an important aspect of remote disease management systems. It involves the forecasting of progression of a disease based on the interpretation of patient data by a disease model. A natural foundation for disease models is physiological knowledge, as such knowledge facilitates building clinically understandable models. This paper proposes ways to represent such knowledge as part of engineering principles employed in building clinically practical probabilistic models. The methodology has been used to construct a temporal Bayesian network model for preeclampsia-a pregnancy-related disorder. The model is the first of its kind and an integral part of a mobile home-monitoring system intended for use in daily pregnancy care. We conducted an evaluation study with actual patient data to obtain insight into the model's performance and suitability. The results obtained are encouraging and show the potential of exploiting physiological knowledge for personalised decision-support systems.},

abstract = {1.Rivers and their catchments are complex, dynamic and non-equilibrium systems. Although the general functioning of these ecosystems is familiar, the characteristics of particular sites are often poorly known and accurate prediction of future behaviour to inform management decisions is extremely difficult. 2.Simple relationships between river nutrient concentrations and the health of river ecosystems do not exist. Natural variability and practical and technical constraints reduce our ability to set nutrient targets to protect river ecosystems. Particularly challenging is the use of simple dose-response relationships as regulatory threshold targets, whereby sections of river are classified as either passing or failing to meet good ecological status. 3.Ecologically meaningful frameworks are needed that take account of the epistemic uncertainty associated with our predictions. Such frameworks should have clearly defined goals; be holistic; allow for natural variability; help to define ecologically acceptable environmental regimes; recognise that significant uncertainties mean that we will often be using indices rather than absolute measures; and use measures that explicitly include uncertainty estimates. Such approaches allow those outside the decision-making process to understand the level of environmental precaution included in the management of complex systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Given the importance of transit time, little guidance exists for the application of transit time modeling in complex catchment systems. This paper presents an evaluation and review of the transit time literature in the context of catchments and water transit time estimation. It is motivated by new and emerging interests in transit time estimation in catchment hydrology and the need to distinguish approaches and assumptions in groundwater applications from catchment applications. The review is focused on lumped parameter transit time modeling for water draining catchments and provides a critical analysis of unresolved issues when applied at the catchment-scale. These issues include: (1) input characterization, (2) recharge estimation, (3) data record length problems, (4) stream sampling issues, (5) selection of transit time distributions, and (6) model evaluation. The intent is to promote new advances in catchment hydrology by clarifying and formalizing the assumptions, limitations, and methodologies in applying transit time models to catchments.},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of nitrate have long provided a tool for tracking environmental sources and biological transformations. However, divergent interpretations of fundamental nitrate isotope systematics exist among disciplinary divisions. In an effort to transcend disciplinary boundaries of terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry, we use a quantitative model for coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate founded on benchmarks established from microbial cultures, to reconcile decades of nitrate isotopic measurements in freshwater and seawater and move toward a unified understanding of cycling processes and isotope systematics. Our findings indicate that denitrification operates within the pervasive context of nitrite reoxidation mechanisms, specifically highlighting the relative importance of nitrification in marine denitrifying systems and anammox in groundwater aquifers.},

abstract = {15N tracing studies in combination with analyses via process-based models are the current “state-of-the-art” technique to quantify gross nitrogen (N) transformation rates in soils. A crucial component of this technique is the optimization algorithm which primarily decides how many model parameters can simultaneously be estimated. Recently, we published a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which has the potential to simultaneously estimate large number of parameters in 15N tracing models [M{\"{u}}ller et al., 2007. Estimation of parameters in complex 15N tracing models by Monte Carlo sampling. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 39, 715–726]. Here, we present the results of a reanalysis of datasets by Kirkham and Bartholomew [1954. Equations for following nutrient transformations in soil, utilizing tracer data. Soil Science Society of America Proceedings 18, 33–34], Myrold and Tiedje [1986. Simultaneous estimation of several nitrogen cycle rates using 15N: theory and application. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 18, 559–568] and Watson et al. [2000. Overestimation of gross N transformation rates in grassland soils due to non-uniform exploitation of applied and native pools. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 32, 2019–2030] using the MCMC technique. Analytical solutions such as the ones derived by Kirkham and Bartholomew [1954. Equations for following nutrient transformations in soil, utilizing tracer data. Soil Science Society of America Proceedings 18, 33–34] result in gross rates without uncertainties. We show that the analysis of the same data sets with the MCMC method provides standard deviations for gross N transformations. The standard deviations are further reduced if realistic data uncertainties are considered. Reanalyzing data by Myrold and Tiedje [1986. Simultaneous estimation of several nitrogen cycle rates using 15N: theory and application. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 18, 559–568] (Capac soil) resulted in a model fit similar to the one of the original analysis but with more precise estimates of gross N transformations. In addition, our analysis showed that small N transformations such as heterotrophic nitrification, which was neglected in the original analysis, could be quantified for this soil. Watson et al. [2000. Overestimation of gross N transformation rates in grassland soils due to non-uniform exploitation of applied and native pools. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 32, 2019–2030] provided evidence of a non-uniform exploitation of applied and native N that led to an overestimation of gross N transformations. Reanalyzing the data (CENIT soil, low N application) with the M{\"{u}}ller et al. [2007. Estimation of parameters in complex 15N tracing models by Monte Carlo sampling. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 39, 715–726] model where NH4+ oxidation was set to Michaelis–Menten kinetics resulted in a satisfactory fit between modeled and observed data, indicating that the observed artifact by Watson et al. [2000. Overestimation of gross N transformation rates in grassland soils due to non-uniform exploitation of applied and native pools. Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 32, 2019–2030] was mainly due to inappropriate kinetic settings. Our study shows that the combination of a MCMC method with 15N tracing models is able to consider more complex and possibly more realistic models and kinetic settings to estimate gross N transformation rates and thus overcomes restriction of previous 15N tracing techniques.},

abstract = {Riparian zones have been investigated in order to determine the processes that control the removal of agriculturally derived nitrate from groundwater; however, many gaps exist in our understanding of the functioning of riparian zones as regulators of nitrate fluxes in shallow groundwater. In this study, a reactive-transport model is applied to simulate organic carbon, nitrate, and nitrogen isotope behavior during denitrification in a river riparian zone. The model includes the reactive-transport processes presented by MacQuarrie and Sudicky [J. Contam. Hydrol. 47 (2001) 53], but has been extended to compute nitrogen isotope fractionation during biogeochemical reactions. Numerical simulation results have been compared to field data from a well-characterized river riparian aquifer and the comparison shows that the model captures the essential reactive-transport processes for major reactive species, including $\delta$15N. A surficial peat zone is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the supply of this DOC to underlying sands and gravels by hydrodynamic processes controls the denitrification of upland nitrate flowing into the riparian zone. The model results support the previously proposed conceptual models for denitrification in riparian aquifers in that enriched $\delta$15N, declining DOC, and declining groundwater NO3−–N concentrations all occur within a relatively thin (1.5 m) zone. The simulated isotope enrichment factors for selected locations within the model domain range from −2{\%} to −8‰, and it is noted that these values are significantly lower than the value specified in the model input. This suggests that it would be very difficult to derive accurate isotopic enrichment factors from a limited number of piezometers in such riparian aquifers. Numerical sensitivity analyses show that denitrification can occur at depths as great as 4 m below the ground surface, but the overall nitrate mass removal capacity of the riparian zone will decrease as the groundwater flow system becomes thicker.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to examine whether the applications of N-inputs (compost and fertilizer) having different N isotopic compositions ($\delta$15N) produce isotopically different inorganic-N and to investigate the effect of soil moisture regimes on the temporal variations in the $\delta$15N of inorganic-N in soils. To do so, the temporal variations in the concentrations and the $\delta$15N of NH4+ and NO3− in soils treated with two levels (0 and 150 mg Nkg−1) of ammonium sulfate ($\delta$15N=−2.3‰) and compost (+13.9‰) during a 10-week incubation were compared by changing soil moisture regime after 6 weeks either from saturated to unsaturated conditions or vice versa. Another incubation study using 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate (3.05 15N atom{\%}) was conducted to estimate the rates of nitrification and denitrification with a numerical model FLUAZ. The $\delta$15N values of NH4+ and NO3− were greatly affected by the availability of substrate for each of the nitrification and denitrification processes and the soil moisture status that affects the relative predominance between the two processes. Under saturated conditions for 6 weeks, the $\delta$15N of NH4+ in soils treated with fertilizer progressively increased from +2.9‰ at 0.5 week to +18.9‰ at 6 weeks due to nitrification. During the same period, NO3− concentrations were consistently low and the corresponding $\delta$15N increased from +16.3 to +39.2‰ through denitrification. Under subsequent water-unsaturated conditions, the NO3− concentrations increased through nitrification, which resulted in the decrease in the $\delta$15N of NO3−. In soils, which were unsaturated for the first 6-weeks incubation, the $\delta$15N of NH4+ increased sharply at 0.5 week due to fast nitrification. On the other hand, the $\delta$15N of NO3− showed the lowest value at 0.5 week due to incomplete nitrification, but after a subsequence increase, they remained stable while nitrification and denitrification were negligible between 1 and 6 weeks. Changing to saturated conditions after the initial 6-weeks incubation, however, increased the $\delta$15N of NO3− progressively with a concurrent decrease in NO3− concentration through denitrification. The differences in $\delta$15N of NO−3 between compost and fertilizer treatments were consistent throughout the incubation period. The $\delta$15N of NO3− increased with the addition of compost (range: +13.0 to +35.4‰), but decreased with the addition of fertilizer (−10.8 to +11.4‰), thus resulting in intermediate values in soils receiving both fertilizer and compost (−3.5 to +20.3‰). Therefore, such differences in $\delta$15N of NO3− observed in this study suggest a possibility that the $\delta$15N of upland-grown plants receiving compost would be higher than those treated with fertilizer because NO3− is the most abundant N for plant uptake in upland soils.},

Many different possible flow regimes are identified, however, in this paper attention is focused on flow-through water bodies, as these are the flow regimes observed in field validation. Two shallow lakes on the Swan Coastal Plain of south-west Western Australia are the subject of field studies where hydrogeochemical and stable isotopes are used to validate the flow-through groundwater flow regime predicted by the modelling confirming the validity of the approach. The flow regime transition diagrams introduced in earlier papers are extended to include consideration of the hydrogeochemical and stable isotopic indices ClL/Cl+ and (1000+$\delta$L)/(1000+$\delta$+). These ratios are introduced as an additional two of nine non-dimensional ratios that are necessary to analyse the problem. The ratios represent the chloride and isotopic composition (ClL and $\delta$L), respectively, in the groundwater release zones of the lakes, relative to these parameters in the groundwater capture zone (Cl+ and $\delta$+) for the lake. Field data from the case studies plotted on appropriately configured transition diagrams demonstrates the overall validity of the modelling approach and its underlying assumptions. It is concluded that isotopic and hydrogeochemical data are invaluable in interpreting the interaction between lakes or wetlands and regional aquifers as it is very difficult to make physical or hydraulic measurements in the field that allow an understanding of lake–aquifer interaction. The tools and concepts developed that are summarized in the presented transition diagrams are invaluable starting points for the consideration and analysis of other case-specific examples of groundwater–surface water interaction and will improve the scientific basis of decision-making concerning lake and wetland management and groundwater interaction by water resource and environmental managers.},

abstract = {The prevailing opinion on the temporal origin of water in a hillslope stormflow hydrograph is that the pre-event water represents a dominant fraction. Such conclusion is usually based on hydrograph separation techniques using stable water isotopes (or other conservative tracers) in conjunction with a mass balance approach. In this study, a two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to study preferential flow of water and transport of Oxygen-18 (O-18) in a vertical cross-section of a hillslope located in a temperate spruce forest. The effects of hydrodynamic mixing and the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic signatures on estimated pre-event/event water fractions in the hillslope discharge were studied by means of numerical simulation experiments. Pre-event and event water contributions to hillslope stormflow were evaluated using a two-component mass balance approach combined with the 2D flow and transport simulations involving real as well as synthetic O-18 signatures. Long-term simulations of O-18 transport in the hillslope segment were compared with the observed O-18 content in soil water and in the hillslope effluent. The results of the long-term simulations indicated significant mixing of pre-event and event water occurring near the subsurface trench and in the soil above the soil–bedrock interface where the transfer of O-18 from the soil matrix to the preferential pathways takes place. Despite the dominant role of preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow, the pre-event water formed 52–84{\%} of total subsurface stormflow. The mass balance approach failed in partitioning the hillslope discharge into the pre-event/event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall–runoff episodes due to similar natural isotopic signatures of pre-event and event water. The analysis showed that spatially and temporally variable exchange of O-18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the estimates of the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrodynamic mixing in the flow domain played an important role in the interpretation of the isotope-based hydrograph separation.},

@article{VanderHoven2002,
abstract = {An objective common to many watershed studies is to separate storm hydrographs into two components: water that was present in the watershed prior to a storm event (soil moisture and groundwater) and water which fell on the watershed during the storm. To use this approach, a number of assumptions must be made including that the composition of water in the soil moisture and groundwater reservoirs are constant and known. The objective of this paper is to show that in settings where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways for flow, steady state mass balance calculations for quantitative hydrograph separation may be in error. We present field data from a site where flow and transport are dominated by preferential pathways (relict fractures in saprolite of sedimentary rocks) which indicate that the $\delta$18O content of the water in the unsaturated and shallow saturated zones is not constant over the course of a storm event. We use a numerical model to further explore the interactions between the fractures and surrounding matrix. Both the field data and modeling results indicate that the $\delta$18O of the previous storm event(s) has a strong influence on water in the fractures. On the time scale of a storm event, only the water in the matrix immediately surrounding the fracture mixes with water in the fracture, while the bulk of the matrix is isolated from fracture flow. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the $\delta$18O in the subsurface and the isolation of the most of the matrix water from flow in fractures make the measurement of a singular $\delta$18O value for subsurface reservoirs problematic and the assumption of a constant value doubtful. Since most near-surface geologic materials have preferential flow paths, we suggest that quantitative hydrograph separation using mass balance techniques is not possible in most situations. Future field and modeling investigations using the approach outlined here could be designed to explore the important temporal and spatial scales of variability in watersheds, and lead to a more quantitative approach to storm hydrograph separation.},

abstract = {The groundwater tracers, deuterium (2H or D) and oxygen-18 (18O) are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin, rate and temperature. Quantitative methods able to interpret $\delta$D and $\delta$18O mobility in the subsurface, especially under high pressure and temperature conditions, remain the focus of ongoing research. Here we developed an isotope transport module as an add-on to the TOUGH2 simulator, which is able to describe the evolution of $\delta$D and $\delta$18O in groundwater induced by advection, dispersion, water-rock interaction, and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density. The new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow, temperature, fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted, geothermal system in the Guide Basin, China. We found that the density-driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low- and high-density water. In addition, the density-driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone, increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution. The results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs, such as in geothermal systems, the relationship between $\delta$D and $\delta$18O in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow, heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for.},

abstract = {Groundwater age has become a fundamental concept in groundwater hydrology, but ages originating from isotopic analyses are still identified with a lack of clarity and using models that occasionally are unrealistic. If the effect of advection and dispersion on water ages has already been extensively identified, very few studies address the reliability of using radiometric ages as derived from isotopic data to estimate aquifer properties such as average velocities. Using simple one-dimensional and two-dimensional analytical solutions for single-site and two-sites mobile–immobile systems, we compare the radiometric ages to the mean ages (or residence times) as deduced from a direct, physically-based simulation approach (using the mean age equation), and show that the competition between isotope decay rate and dispersion coefficient can generate important discrepancies between the two types of ages. A correction for the average apparent velocity originating from apparent isotopic ages is additionally provided. The particular case of the tritium age dating method is also addressed, and a numerical example is finally given for illustrating the analysis considering a more complex and heterogeneous aquifer system. Our results suggest that age definitions based on the radioactivity of isotopes may not be representative for the mean age of the sample or for the groundwater velocity at given locations, and may not always be suitable for constraining the calibration of hydrogeological models.},

In this review focussed on aquatic ecosystems, we examine the theoretical basis to using stable oxygen isotopes within phosphorus research. We consider the methodological challenges involved in accurately determining $\delta$18Op, given aquatic matrices in which potential sources of contaminant oxygen are ubiquitous.

Atmospheric nitrogen deposition often greatly exceeds streamwater nitrogen losses; the fate of the remaining nitrogen is highly uncertain. Gaseous losses of nitrogen to denitrification are especially poorly documented and are often ignored. Here, we provide isotopic evidence ($\delta$(15)NNO3 and $\delta$(18)ONO3) from shallow groundwater at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest indicating extensive denitrification during midsummer, when transient, perched patches of saturation developed in hillslopes, with poor hydrological connectivity to the stream, while streamwater showed no isotopic evidence of denitrification. During small rain events, precipitation directly contributed up to 34{\%} of streamwater nitrate, which was otherwise produced by nitrification. Together, these measurements reveal the importance of denitrification in hydrologically disconnected patches of shallow groundwater during midsummer as largely overlooked control points for nitrogen loss from temperate forest catchments.},

abstract = {This work reviews applications of stable isotope analysis to the studies of transport and transformation of N species in groundwater under agricultural areas. It summarizes evidence regarding factors affecting the isotopic composition of NO3−, NH4+ and N2O in subsurface, and discusses the use of 11B, 18O, 13C, 34S, 87Sr/86Sr isotopes to support the analysis of $\delta$15N values. The isotopic composition of NO3−, NH4+ and N2O varies depending on their sources and dynamics of N cycle processes. The reported $\delta$15N-NO3− values for sources of NO3− are: soil organic N – +3‰–+8‰, mineral fertilizers – −8‰–+7‰; manure/household waste – +5‰ to +35‰. For NH4+ sources, the isotopic signature ranges are: organic matter – +2.4–+4.1‰, rainwater – −13.4–+2.3‰, mineral fertilizers – −7.4–+5.1‰, household waste – +5–+9‰; animal manure – +8–+11‰. For N2O, isotopic composition depends on isotopic signatures of substrate pools and reaction rates. $\delta$15N values of NO3− are influenced by fractionation effects occurring during denitrification (ɛ=5–40‰), nitrification (ɛ=5–35‰) and DNRA (ɛ not reported). The isotopic signature of NH4+ is also affected by nitrification and DNRA as well as mineralization (ɛ=1‰), sorption (ɛ=1–8‰), anammox (ɛ=4.3–7.4‰) and volatilization (ɛ=25‰). As for the N2O, production of N2O leads to its depletion in 15N, whereas consumption – to enrichment in 15N. The magnitude of fractionation effects occurring during the considered processes depends on temperature, pH, DO, C/NO3− ratio, size of the substrate pool, availability of electron donors, water content in subsoil, residence time, land use, hydrogeology. While previous studies have accumulated rich data on isotopic composition of NO3− in groundwater, evidence remains scarce in the cases of NH4+ and N2O. Further research is required to consider variability of $\delta$15N-NH4+ and $\delta$15N-N2O in groundwater across agricultural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Elevated nutrient inputs have led to increased eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems worldwide. An understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources is imperative for effective water quality management. Stable isotope values of nitrate ($\delta$15NNO3-, $\delta$18ONO3-) can complement conventional water quality monitoring programs to help differentiate natural sources of NO3− from anthropogenic inputs and estimate the processes involved in N cycling within an ecosystem. We measured nutrient concentrations, $\delta$15NNO3-, and $\delta$18ONO3- in 76 locations along a salinity gradient from the lower end of the Pearl River Estuary, one of China's largest rivers discharging into the South China Sea, towards the open ocean. NO3− concentrations decreased with increasing salinity, indicative of conservative mixing of eutrophic freshwater and oligotrophic seawater. However, our data did not follow conservative mixing patterns. At salinities {\textless}20 psu, samples exhibited decreasing NO3−concentrations with almost unchanged NO3− isotope values, indicating simple dilution. At salinities {\textgreater}20 psu, NO3− concentrations decreased, while dual NO3− isotopes increased, suggesting mixing and/or other transformation processes. Our analysis yielded mean estimates for isotope enrichment factors (15$\epsilon$ = −2.02‰ and 18$\epsilon$ = −3.37‰), $\Delta$(15,18) = -5.5‰ and $\delta$15NNO3- - $\delta$15NNO2- = 12.3‰. After consideration of potential alternative sources (sewage, atmospheric deposition and groundwater) we concluded that there are three plausible interpretations for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour (1) NO3− uptake by assimilation (2) in situ NO3− production (from fixation-derived nitrogen and nitrification of sewage-derived effluents) and (3) input of groundwater nitrate carrying a denitrification signal. Through this study, we propose a simple workflow that incorporates a synthesis of numerous isotope-based studies to constrain sources and behaviour of NO3− in urbanized marine environments.},

abstract = {Identifying nonpoint phosphorus (P) sources in a watershed is essential for addressing cultural eutrophication and for proposing best-management solutions. The oxygen isotope ratio of phosphate ($\delta$18OPO4) can shed light on P sources and P cycling in ecosystems. This is the first assessment of the $\delta$18OPO4 distribution in a whole catchment, namely, the Yasu River Watershed in Japan. The observed $\delta$18OPO4 values in the river water varied spatially from 10.3‰ to 17.6‰. To identify P sources in the watershed, we used an isoscape approach involving a multiple-linear-regression model based on land use and lithological types. We constructed two isoscape models, one using data only from the whole watershed and the other using data from the small tributaries. The model results explain 69{\%} and 96{\%} of the spatial variation in the river water $\delta$18OPO4. The lower R2 value for the whole watershed model is attributed to the relatively large travel time for P in the main stream of the lower catchment that can result in cumul...},

abstract = {Procedures for source apportionment of nutrients transported in rivers and streams are often uncertain and difficult to validate. In this study, we investigated if the oxygen isotope ratios in stream dissolved phosphate ($\delta$18OP) can be used to distinguish between the phosphorus (P) originating from agricultural runoff and from rural sewage, at different periods of the year. Water was collected from septic tanks, drainage wells and the stream outlet in a small (7.3 km2) agricultural catchment to capture variations in the isotope signature at different flow events. The $\delta$18OP signature in septic tank effluent (+13.2 to +14.5‰) was significantly different from that in drainage water (+9.0 to +15.7‰). Four different septic tanks had surprisingly similar isotope signature when 24 h composite samples were collected. Most of the water samples were not in oxygen isotope equilibrium. In three drainage wells, the $\delta$18OP signature varied from +7.8 up to +15.7‰ with higher values in periods with a larger contribution of superficial streamflow generation. A rainfall soon after manure had been spread resulted in a $\delta$18OP of 15.7‰ in a drainage well, and was also reflected in a similar value at the catchment outlet. This implies that the source isotope signal may be conserved during moderate or high flows. A three end-member model including the geological background would be a useful start to quantify the P contribution from diverse sources. Temporal differences in biological activity and the predominant transport pathways through soil profiles must be considered along with information about fertilisation. In combination with hydrological modelling of water pathways, this may considerably improve our understanding of catchment P losses.},

@article{Granger2017,
abstract = {The need to reduce both point and diffuse phosphorus pollution to aquatic ecosystems is widely recognised and in order to achieve this, identification of the different pollutant sources is essential. Recently, a stable isotope approach using oxygen isotopes within phosphate ($\delta$18OPO4) has been used in phosphorus source tracing studies. This approach was applied in a one-off survey in September 2013 to the River Taw catchment in south-west England where elevated levels of phosphate have been reported. River water $\delta$18OPO4 along the main channel varied little, ranging from +17.1 to +18.8‰. This was no {\textgreater}0.3‰ different to that of the isotopic equilibrium with water (E$\delta$18OPO4). The $\delta$18OPO4 in the tributaries was more variable (+17.1 to +18.8‰), but only deviated from E$\delta$18OPO4 by between 0.4 and 0.9‰. Several potential phosphate sources within the catchment were sampled and most had a narrow range of $\delta$18OPO4 values similar to that of river E$\delta$18OPO4. Discharge from two waste water treatment plants had different and distinct $\delta$18OPO4 from one another ranging between +16.4 and +19.6‰ and similar values to that of a dairy factory final effluent (+16.5 to +17.8‰), mains tap water (+17.8 to +18.4‰), and that of the phosphate extracted from river channel bed sediment (+16.7 to +17.6‰). Inorganic fertilizers had a wide range of values (+13.3 to +25.9‰) while stored animal wastes were consistently lower (+12.0 to +15.0‰) than most other sources and E$\delta$18OPO4. The distinct signals from the waste water treatment plants were lost within the river over a short distance suggesting that rapid microbial cycling of phosphate was occurring, because microbial cycling shifts the isotopic signal towards E$\delta$18OPO4. This study has added to the global inventory of phosphate source $\delta$18OPO4 values, but also demonstrated the limitations of this approach to identifying phosphate sources, especially at times when microbial cycling is high.},

The riverine weighted average $\delta$18Op value was +11‰ and may represent one source of phosphate to the Lake. The lake $\delta$18Op values indicated that there must be one or more as yet uncharacterized source(s) of phosphate with a high $\delta$18Op value. Potential sources other than rivers are not yet well-characterized with respect to $\delta$18O of phosphate, but we speculate that a likely source may be the release of phosphate from sediments under reducing conditions created during anoxic events in the hypolimnion of the central basin of Lake Erie.

abstract = {Globally, fertilizers are identified as principle sources of nitrate in waters of intensely cultivated areas. Here this general concept is appraised on a seasonal basis over a two year period, under temperate climatic conditions. Water ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) and nitrate ($\delta$15N and $\delta$18O) isotopes in surface water and groundwater suggest that freshwater is acting as a transport vector conducting nitrate from agricultural soils to groundwater and ultimately to surface water. Measured nitrate isotopes of organic and inorganic fertilizers and of nitrate in groundwater are used to constrain a conceptual apportionment model quantifying the relative seasonal N contributions in an area of intense potato production. Source inputs differ strongly between the growing (summer and fall) and non-growing (winter and spring) periods. Chemical fertilizers and soil organic matter equally dominate and contribute to the growing period load, whereas soil organic matter dominates the non-growing period load, and accounts for over half of the overall annual nitrogen charge. These findings reveal the magnitude of nitrogen cycling by soil organic matter, and point to the benefits of controlling the timing of its nitrate release from this organic material. We conclude that strategies to attenuate contamination by nitrate in waters of temperate climate row-cropping regions must consider nitrogen cycling by soil organic matter, including the crucial role of crop residues throughout both the growing and non-growing seasons.},

As a relatively new tool, stable isotope measurements complement this type of research by providing an extra label to characterize origin of the transported material, its transfer mechanisms, and natural versus anthropogenic influences. These new stable isotope techniques are scalable across a wide range of geographic and temporal scales. This review focuses on three aspects of hydrological and geochemical river research that are of prime importance to the policy issues of climate change and include utilization of stable water and carbon isotopes: (i) silicate and carbonate weathering in river basins, (ii) the riverine carbon and oxygen cycles, and (iii) water balances at the catchment scale. Most studies at watershed scales currently focus on water and carbon balances but future applications hold promise to integrate sediment fluxes and turnover, ground and surface water interactions, as well as the understanding of contaminant sources and their effects in river systems.},

abstract = {Process-based hydrological models have a long history dating back to the 1960s. Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth's system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment of uncertainty.},

@article{White2016,
abstract = {We have developed pyEMU, a python framework for Environmental Modeling Uncertainty analyses, open-source tool that is non-intrusive, easy-to-use, computationally efficient, and scalable to highly-parameterized inverse problems. The framework implements several types of linear (first-order, second-moment (FOSM)) and non-linear uncertainty analyses. The FOSM-based analyses can also be completed prior to parameter estimation to help inform important modeling decisions, such as parameterization and objective function formulation. Complete workflows for several types of FOSM-based and non-linear analyses are documented in example notebooks implemented using Jupyter that are available in the online pyEMU repository. Example workflows include basic parameter and forecast analyses, data worth analyses, and error-variance analyses, as well as usage of parameter ensemble generation and management capabilities. These workflows document the necessary steps and provides insights into the results, with the goal of educating users not only in how to apply pyEMU, but also in the underlying theory of applied uncertainty quantification.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} In the past decade, difficulties encountered in reproducing the results of a cancer study at Duke University resulted in a scandal and an investigation which concluded that tools used for data management, analysis, and modeling were inappropriate for the documentation of the study, let alone the reproduction of the results. New protocols were developed which require that data analysis and modeling be carried out with scripts that can be used to reproduce the results and are a record of all decisions and interpretations made during an analysis or a modeling effort. In the hydrological sciences, we face similar challenges and need to develop similar standards for transparency and repeatability of results. A promising route is to start making use of open-source languages (such as R and Python) to write scripts and to use collaborative coding environments (such as Git) to share our codes for inspection and use by the hydrological community. An important side-benefit to adopting such protocols is consistency and efficiency among collaborators.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Goodwell2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved. Ecohydrologic fluxes within atmosphere, vegetation, and soil systems exhibit a joint variability that arises from forcing and feedback interactions. These interactions cause fluctuations to propagate between variables at many time scales. In an ecosystem, this connectivity dictates responses to climate change, land-cover change, and weather events and must be characterized to understand resilience and sensitivity. We use an information theory-based approach to quantify connectivity in the form of information flow associated with the propagation of fluctuations between variables. We apply this approach to study ecosystems that experience changes in dry-season moisture availability due to rainfall and drought conditions. We use data from two transects with flux towers located along elevation gradients and quantify redundant, synergistic, and unique flow of information between lagged sources and targets to characterize joint asynchronous time dependencies. At the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in Idaho, a dry-season rainfall pulse leads to increased connectivity from soil and atmospheric variables to heat and carbon fluxes. At the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory in California, separate sets of dominant drivers characterize two sites at which fluxes exhibit different drought responses. For both cases, our information flow-based connectivity characterizes dominant drivers and joint variability before, during, and after disturbances. This approach to gauge the responsiveness of ecosystem fluxes under multiple sources of variability furthers our understanding of complex ecohydrologic systems.},
